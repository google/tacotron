      <p>Our work makes initial progress on naturalistic, audio-native, long-form speech generation:
        <ul>
          <li>We introduce <strong>SpeechSSM</strong>, the <strong>first spoken language model for long-form speech</strong>. Our 2B and 9B models:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>produces speech <strong>textlessly and in constant memory</strong>, for <strong>unbounded real-time generation</strong>;</li>
            <li>demonstrates <strong>generative length extrapolation</strong>, e.g. 4 min. in training to 16 min;</li>
            <li>can be trained for either read speech or <strong>extemporaneous speech (SpeechSSM-X)</strong>.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>We define <strong>evaluations for long-form speech continuation</strong>, from time-stratified evaluations to modern NLG metrics like LLM-as-judge.</li>
          <li>We release <strong>LibriSpeech-Long</strong>, a 3-4min reformat of <a href="https://www.openslr.org/12">LibriSpeech dev+test sets</a> for future long-form speech processing research.</li>
        </ul>

                  There was no telling what they had disturbed the day before. Philip, who had a tendency to see the failures of travel with a good deal of ambition, and a perfectly happy way, too, moved over to the gate.<br>
                  The great buildings resembled the pile of beer, with the little river fronts hanging down in length before them. The weather temperature also, was very transversally clear. It would seem as if Philip had laid out a pair of scissors, and a little box, and tried to pull the panel and make money. There was some river where people were abusing each other for giving songs to the devil. And such a body of music had been given by Horace Barrows, who had come in from the world of Grossi and Tortel, to sing wonderful songs. The apple groves were in a small cataract where the people could pick out the little gardens full of ugly metal, and sing their strange low melody, no better than their practice.<br>
                  "I don't think there's the nearest aerial to the traveling song to do," said Philip.
                  <br><span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  It was four o'clock, when Pierre called Prince Albert and explained what had happened. The school was lost in completing it, for the four o'clock had been driven out of Westchester in a very few minutes.<br>
                  At last Philip was exhausted. He didn't hear a word, but entered the coach and was driven by Prince Albert into the street. "I have some news to discuss. Captain Kidd will come for you presently," was the cordial response of the Princess Maria Theresa, who was still in her green satin. They all talked gallantly, and Philip believed that it was a genuine disaster.<br>
                  "They would have to take him for supper, and Mr. Phineas, I suppose you wanted to join the sport. I told you he was a handsome fellow," said Philip smiling frankly at the boy.<br><span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  So Philip and Princess Maria went to look for him in the Dragon Springs garden, and there most of the guests were gone. Philip was terribly excited.<br>
                  "They must get some of the guests in the kitchen," exclaimed the guests, selecting a bright fire in the bright, sunny spot. Philip had never felt so happy in his life before.<br>
                  "Did you hear about the Dragon Springs?" he asked, after a pause.<br>
                  "Yes, they say that when they were strong enough, the famous Albanians, British and Germans, were worthy."

                <div class="transcription">"Oh, it's easy enough to make a fortune," Henry said.<br>
                  "It seems to be easier than it is, I begin to think," replied Philip.<br>
                  "Well, why don't you go into something? You'll never dig it out of the Astor Library." <br>
              
                  To the young American, here or elsewhere, the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open. There is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon. He is embarrassed which to choose, and is not likely to waste years in dallying with his chances before giving himself to the serious tug and strain of a single object. He has no traditions to bind him or guide him, and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed and make a new way for himself.<br>
              
                  Philip Sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for 10 years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain, he felt that he could be a rich man.<br>
                  He wanted to be rich, he had a sincere desire for a fortune, but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated about addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it.<br>
              
                  He never walked Broadway, a part of its tide of abundant shifting life, without feeling something of the flush of wealth, and unconsciously taking the elastic step of one well-to-do in this prosperous world. Especially at night in the crowded theater—Philip was too young to remember the old Chambers Street box where the serious Burton led his hilarious and pagan crew—in the intervals of the screaming comedy when the orchestra scraped and grunted and tooted its dissolute tunes, the world seemed full of opportunities to Philip, and his heart exulted with a conscious ability to take any of its prizes he chose to pluck.<br>

                  "He who lays his hand on a woman except in the way of kindness." <br>
                  Do we not all applaud so as to drown the rest of the sentence?<br>
                  Philip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who should lay his hand on a woman, with the exception named, but he learned afterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man, without any exception whatsoever, is always acquitted by the jury.<br>
                  <span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
              
                  He was unable to decide exactly what it should be. Sometimes he thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preach the gospel of repentance; and it even crossed his mind that it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region where the date palm grows and the nightingale's voice is in tune, and the bulbul sings on the off nights. Philip had a good appetite, a sunny temper, and a clear, hearty laugh.

                <div class="transcription">Yes, it must be confessed, Polly was homesick. All her imaginations of her mother’s hard work, increased by her absence, loomed up before her, till she was almost ready to fly home without a minute's warning. At night, when no one knew it, the tears would come racing over the poor forlorn little face and would not be squeezed back. It got to be noticed finally and one and all redoubled their exertions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever. The only place, except in front of the grand piano where Polly approached a state of comparative happiness, was in the greenhouse. Here she would stay, comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics, rejoicing the heart of old Turner the gardener, who since Polly’s first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time. Every chance she could steal after practice hours were over, and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied, was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers. But even with the music and flowers, the dancing light in the eyes went down a little, and Polly, growing more silent and pale, <br>

                  “I don’t know,” said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody, “unless she’d like my new book of travels, or my velocipede,” he added. <br>

                  Polly sat up very straight, and whisked off the tears quickly. “Here, Polly, hold your arms!” he had only strength to gasp. At this the bundle opened suddenly, and out popped Phronsie! “Here I am! I’m here, Polly!” But Polly couldn’t speak, and if Jasper hadn’t caught her just in time, she would have tumbled over backward from the stool, Phronsie and all. “Aren’t you glad I’ve come, Polly?” asked Phronsie, with her little face close to Polly’s own. That brought Polly to.

                <div class="transcription">On Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Burgoyne's invitation and called at her apartment. He found it a delightful little place, and he met charming people there. <span class="noise">[Noise]</span> She had a pleasant sense of joy and gluttony, but here she was much pleased at the present time, and in the first place it came from occasional manner, <span class="noise">[Noise]</span> as alas, from a counting house. He had rendered her hers and he himself had seen her deeply relieved that her reluctances were of the kind. And it seemed that <span class="noise">[Noise]</span> there were a prospect of adopting her to him. To be perfectly clear, as he wrote, the place was but a bridge. She had been so fresh and pleased that the people <span class="noise">[Noise]</span> let her away in peaceful life. She was ready to say what they could to learn for what they live to do in connection with the previous topic and to enjoy <span class="noise">[Noise]</span> <br>

                  On Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Bourgoin's invitation and called at her apartment. He found it a delightful little place, and he met charming people there. He did not mention the World War and the winter Belcher, and only saw half a body that he was beginning to learn English just before the war. Mr. Ellis had mistakenly added that Mr. Wilkinson was enormously fond of all American overtures. Moth Man and Chinese Raleigh would come to the builders someday on a prescription in the Department of Justice to collect Pennsylvania for a classic Syfacare.

                  <br>
                  At six feet away and happily not in any of the little darkened corridors, a pile of front ovens showed below and without a sofa or a cleaner bed in which under her bright eyes Estelle lived. In a room almost as bright as the moon and the flowers in the attics, the view was so interesting that in the office cameras painted the picture white with the moth wing being on the ceiling. Brybead offended and Mary signed up "student friend." He was fortunate in a speciality on rye glasses as far as it could be called special; he thought he would receive one aside from that it had a good taste for carbon and which astonished him so he did not fail to bother. The two early characters were straightforward. Today, though not satisfactorily, the daring idea was carried far and lost its force here by the rhythm always came on the lines. Is this worth trying? Ebo reached for the shells, her eyes were green, her cheeks puffy and sweet. She emptied them on the man. "If your nature angers you," he assured her, "Anger me how?"
                  <br>
                  <span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span>
                  <br>
                  "Can I shall sleep again tonight?" Estelle shrinks and hides her face in the sleeve of her warador. Since the night that I saw her, she had been just as she had been a very few minutes. It's lovely funny on no trot to be so energetic. I see you've been so enthralled asleep." She ran a header on the piano and a clump of worn blossoms at my feet and began to rough her movements on other six weeks now on the 21st. "I want the hiding place of the sub souls of this guy again."
                  <br>

                  "I suffered terribly that way from my brainy budge about putting this up again. Oh, that's the greatest sin I ever knew." He paused then moved his chair back. She rose gravely and walked around. "I've been in a ridiculous position," he growled. His rusty footfall climbed fairly up the stairs and a quarter of an hour later, Director Trent stopped by the front door with a distinction.

                <div class="transcription">On Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Bourgoin's invitation and called at her apartment. He found it a delightful little place and he met charming people there.<br>
                  For five minutes when Alexander came downstairs, talking as long as he had time to know, he said that Miss Bourgoin had been shown some pictures. He seemed to be quite satisfied. He was afraid to talk to Alexander, not much of him. He was afraid of no one but Alexander and on this afternoon's recreation he heard her chattering away in his dining room.<br>
                  He was very anxious to get to a picture for short but the picture pleased him and helped him much. At the first glance he found it decidedly refined and ornamental. He was wearing a handsome, dark mustache autumn. And the impression he made on him was especially great at the beginning, a large strip of pink and blue.<br>
                  
                  <span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  
                  There was one little picture which Mr. Bourgoin tried to put in his way but when he had one, he really carried it with him. If that wasn't all the entertainment they'd have to wait, he mentioned, and began putting it into his pocketbook, which was written on huge black needles, and which was surrounded by a confusion of rounded tiles and someone had a large scattered notebook in it. It was written in a pair of rather large crinoline boots that appeared every minute and made a pleasant dream. Mademoiselle did not make more than half a picture. This was a great experience with some pictures containing Alexander's pocketbook.<br>
                  
                  <span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  
                  "What time is it?" I asked, looking up at the handsome disembodied sky.<br>
                  "You know, Mr. Bourgoin calls for it."<br>
                  Mr. Bourgoin came downstairs and everyone came to see us. I liked the picture, and I found Mr. Bourgoin in the same attitude with a family card in his hands and having a private trouble face before him.<br>
                  "I hope so, mademoiselle," I said. "I suppose it is a shame to bang with a horse when he has not got any food."

                <div class="transcription">On Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Bergoyne's invitation and called at her apartment. He found it a delightful little place, and he met charming people there. Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty and competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the tea.<br>
                  Alexander arrived early, and some twenty odd people dropped in during the course of the afternoon.<br>
                  Hugh McConnell came with his sister and stood about managing his tea cup awkwardly and watching everyone out of his deep set, faded eyes. He was never so witty or so sharp here as elsewhere, and Alexander thought he behaved as if he were an elderly relative come into a young girl's party.<br>
                  The editor of a monthly review came with his wife, and Lady Kildare, the Irish philanthropist, brought her young nephew, Robert Owen, who had come up from Oxford and who was visibly excited and gratified by his first introduction to Miss Bergoyne. Hilda was very nice to him, and he sat on the edge of his chair, flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar.<br>
                  
                  <span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  
                  He had a long talk with McConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and he left in a discontented state of mind. For the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure.<br>
                  On Thursday afternoon he cut short a committee meeting, jumped into a hansom and drove to Bedford Square.<br>
                  When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs.<br>
                  
                  <span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  
                  "I can't tell you how glad I am to have you so pretty and comfortable here, and to hear everyone saying such nice things about you. You've got awfully nice friends," he added humbly, picking up a little jade elephant from her desk. "Those fellows are all very loyal, even Mainhall. They don't talk of anyone else as they do of you." <br>
                  Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: "I've a neat little sum in the bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway. It's not worth much, but I love it."

                <div class="transcription">She was the most agreeable woman I've ever known in her position. She would have been worthy of any whatever. It was long ago. And this episode was long before. Since since I was warming my hands at the animals, she was a child. She was the most peculiar woman I ever saw. You seem to understand.
                  <br><span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  We must find someone by accident. You are trying to discover something. I know the secret of the animal cover. You are not quite easy to find. And again he shook his head, abstractedly. Mr. Emerson would never have disputed that question, said Voice dryly. But you don't in the least disregard it. Who is the animal? Well, you shall have time before I find my master. Allen left the room and started furiously to his feet. He hurried on. And how pleased he was with the things that came before him. He had forbidden it. But nothing of his dream followed. And then he saw that he was going not quite as fast as he could have wished himself. What was the next course ahead of him? He had no preference, but he found the third, and they led him home. He wondered if he could find another place, indeed, in that strange place two weeks before. The rest were boarded. So he thought, it doesn't look very bad work. It's quite the best place for me. And I would like to go by the road and buy some food. He felt indisposed. But he found expedient. He had sat in that room, on one corner of his face. He was in no hurry to hurry on. And yet, he was convinced that he had found his way.
                  <br><span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                   He looked down at the animal, hiding his body and mind from hope. Then lifted them again. "Scree, scree," cried the beast. And before Mildred could speak, he was going to her, and clinging strongly to his arm. "Oh, what is that?" in a voice from somewhere beyond the clutch of the magic dog tree. "Help! Help!" Someone coming quickly found she was gone, and hardly had her foot slipped when, running in the dark, she was lifted up and turned about for it to tell the story of the strong creature she was going to save up. 
                   <br><span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  And Park watched to see what was going on. He went to his people and asked them to eat and drink. They had another room, and before they wanted, they dropped off. "I am glad to see you, my friend, Lily," said Dick. "I feel better. Will you have the goodness to tell me what I am doing here? I want to do just this or that particular thing," returned Park. "We must have a longer road." He fell down upon his hands and knees. "The consequences are," he said, "that wild beasts can stay in the desert." After this, they began to finish their business. The meal kept going from morning to night, but after a while it was cleaned up, and he took from them as much as he could carry away as well. He was all shaken and twisted, but in another moment Lily came to him. "Don't we dare shoot a bear in the desert," he said. "And she has told me that I shall not go near the desert. It is very terrible," they murmured. "Lily, we don't want to hear you." The cobbler shouted, "Oh, please, Miss Carne. We must go back again." But he did not go back, for Park was watching for him at the house opposite him. 
                  <br><span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  The bear followed him, but after a time, they came to another meadow, where there was a larger one. Only the beasts had nothing to eat. Just as the children had started, the bear came to an end. He could hunt for a minute, and as he waited, he saw someone coming, and leaning out of the middle of the field, he saw someone coming at a lower altitude. Lily lifted his jacket up, and the beast ran across the meadow to him. "Go back." And off they went, for they were perplexed. "What have you got to do with me?" the cobbler shouted. 
                  <br><span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  It was all his only chance. And then he thought of what he had been over and above to guard against, for his own sake, with everything he had. He sat down on the rough bush bench without looking behind him. He hurried along by the branches until it was so dark.

                <div class="transcription">From the evil seed of lust, all other deadly sins had sprung forth. Pride in himself and contempt of others, covetousness in using money for their subsequent life, memory of poverty kindling the anger of the judge. Hairy, staining clothes of brothers, rum slaving sisterly and dear children in a pitiless passion. The white spots and sober face and rough, hard-mannered features, but wealth of evidence to decide. This distress would not be terrible.
                  <br><span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  "And so you give me a reason for it." Said Tobinos. "Why then should you choose a reason for it? For why could I not accept what I believed to be good?" The yeast answered with an effort, "Lord, what is this that I have not said? You are skillful hatchet. I am a very little one to you." He added, "Ah, how fine is your friend! You were not at all fit to walk alone like a fox. And I am going to sit with you here. I labor to have my yeast among you in a better place. It will make you ask."
                  <br><span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  "I want you to understand." Said Tobinos. "You want to know whether you deserve what you have given me to believe. Would you still like to believe it? Lord, I want to know whether I can believe and love all and such a man. I was there thinking, Lord, what will not I do? Lord, what will not I do?" Thereupon, Gorab lifted himself lightly from the wizard's chest, coughed, took his foot out of the chest, and said, "Lord, I labor to give you life and strength.
                  <br><span class="more-speech">(more speech…)</span><br>
                  "Go straight up. Be thou one of the men in the world and bless your pride." Came from Gorab as he opened his eyes. The red king was really blinded in body. And his glances contracted with a fixed look. He felt the coffer coming and going fast. Gorab stepped towards him and shouted some new well-known word to him, and ordered the wizard to bound him in a bowl of bread into the cave. "Mumgulul, Samko, wake up." Said Tobinos.
